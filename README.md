## Deep Learning and Machine Learning 

### Overview

Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) are subfields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focus on building systems capable of learning from data. These technologies power a wide range of applications, from image and speech recognition to predictive analytics and natural language processing.

I am using Google Colab and Kaggle for my Notebooks.

### Deep Learning

Deep Learning involves training large neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to learn representations of data. These models excel at discovering intricate patterns in large datasets.

#### Key Features of Deep Learning:
- **Neural Networks**: Utilize multiple layers of neurons to model complex relationships.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Specialize in processing grid-like data such as images.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Ideal for sequence data like time series or text.
- **Transfer Learning**: Leverage pre-trained models to build powerful solutions with less data.
